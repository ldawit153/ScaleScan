ScaleScan
ScaleScan is a mobile application built with React Native that enables drivers to scan their weight tickets and quickly send them to a specified email address. This app reduces manual data entry, improves accuracy, and enhances efficiency for dispatch and record-keeping.

Getting Started
Note: Before running the app, make sure you've completed the React Native Environment Setup up to the "Creating a New Application" step.

Features
Camera Scanning: Allows drivers to capture images of their weight tickets using their phone’s camera.
Email Integration: After scanning, drivers can input an email address to send the ticket image directly.
Real-Time Processing: Utilizes asynchronous processing to handle ticket scans and email dispatch in real time, improving workflow speed and efficiency.
Prerequisites
React Native: Developed with React Native for cross-platform support.
React Native Camera: Uses react-native-camera for capturing weight ticket images.
File Handling: Employs react-native-fs for file operations within the app's writable directories.
Technologies Used
React Native: Cross-platform development framework used to build the app for both iOS and Android.
JavaScript/TypeScript: Primary programming languages for implementing app logic and UI components.
REST API: Facilitates secure transmission of scanned ticket data to the dispatch system (optional integration).
React Native Camera: For accessing the phone’s camera to capture weight ticket images.
React Native FS: Manages file storage and handling within the app's filesystem.
Installation
To install and run ScaleScan on your local machine:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ScaleScan.git
cd ScaleScan
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install

yarn install
Running the App
Step 1: Start the Metro Server
Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Start it by running:

bash
Copy code
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
Step 2: Start Your Application
Keep Metro running in its own terminal. In a new terminal, run one of the following commands depending on your target platform:

For Android
bash
Copy code
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS
bash
Copy code
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
If your environment is set up correctly, you should see the app running on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator. Alternatively, you can run the app directly from within Android Studio or Xcode.

Usage
Launch the App: Open ScaleScan on your device.
Scan Weight Ticket: Tap the "Scan Weight Ticket" button to activate the camera and capture the weight ticket.
Enter Email: Input the email address where you want the ticket to be sent.
Send Ticket: Tap "Send Ticket" to send the scanned image to the specified email.
